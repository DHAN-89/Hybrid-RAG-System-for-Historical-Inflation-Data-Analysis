    "**This notebook demonstrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to analyze historical inflation data. It combines traditional data processing with advanced AI techniques: first, it cleans and structures inflation data, then converts it into searchable embeddings. For specific numerical queries, it uses direct analytical functions to ensure accuracy. For broader questions, it retrieves relevant data chunks and employs a Large Language Model (Gemma-2B-it) to generate contextually aware answers. This approach aims to provide both precise analytical insights and flexible, intelligent responses to inflation-related inquiries.**"
